    <p class="Response1">1) In fact, the current software industry can be roughly divided into two major directions. On the one hand, it can be defined as a monopoly software industry, such as Apple and Adobe, which are born for design, and on the other hand, it is an open-source software platform such as GitHub.

        The above two aspects are actually in line with the two-sidedness of things. From the perspective of a monopoly industry, it is not a good thing for a single company to dominate, because they define the standards and trends of design, making the design industry imprisoned to a certain extent. Since practitioners have to rely on this series of software, they will inevitably be standardized by this software, which will weaken their personal style to some extent, and produce design works that are more in line with market requirements. This is an obstacle to the development and improvement of the aesthetic level.
        
        Speaking of the latter, open-source software, compared with monopolistic software, open-source software provides users with more diversified choices. Because this software gives a lot of writing rights, therefore, some people who are proficient in computer compilation can write customized software on the original basis (on the basis of respecting copyright). More extreme is the deciphering of these open-source software by hackers. Although it is an infringement to some extent, these hackers are also flogging software developers to improve their software, so that the original software can be better improved in terms of security and ease of use.
        
        In general, whether it is a monopoly software industry or an open-source software industry, their relationship is complementary. Only when competitors in the monopoly industry appear, can these industries develop better, making software no matter from the ease of use, aesthetics, or price, can be more in line with the needs of the public, as is open source software, but based on this, we all still need to improve copyright awareness, and while enjoying the convenience of open source software, we also need to respect the creators.
        <br><br>
        2) I think one aspect is to absorb a lot of knowledge about aesthetics and design. For example, the history of art in the first academic year is a good supplementary material. We can understand the emergence of an art genre, its age, and even the audience of this art genre. From this knowledge, we can more accurately express our own design works. Furthermore, there is to browse different categories of design works, not limited to knowledge of graphic design works, for example, we can complement our knowledge of aesthetics and design from music, movies, and even different cultures.
        <br><br>
        I think another important skill is the hand-painting skill. Because this skill does not depend on any software, it can truly express the designer's original idea, so it will not be restricted by the software platform.</p>

        <p class="Response2">1.Universal users can actually be understood as ordinary users because the Internet has been accurately divided into different types of applications, like there are reading types of websites - Amazon- kindle, there is YouTube, which focuses on video sharing, and Spotify, which can send music for you. Each website does its own thing, providing a different experience for the average user. Of course, when we use these websites, we need to open multiple websites according to our own preferences to meet our own requirements. For example, I want to listen to the music and read articles, or even stop to write a note. At this time I need to open at least 3 websites to meet my requirements. In contrast, the personal website mentioned by Schwulst has advantages compared to these mature website platforms. Like the example I mentioned before, I want to combine the two functions of reading articles and listening to music. A personal website can provide such a customized experience. You can add music plug-ins to the web page, and let the music plug-ins push the music style that suits you according to your personal preferences. In addition, you can also save your favourite books in the form of codes on personal websites, these are not available at the same time by ordinary portals, in addition, personal websites will have better privacy.
        <br><br>
        2.I think I am just a universal user, I am experiencing the convenience that the Internet brings to me, quoting a sentence from Lialina's article "We, general purpose users — not hackers and not people — who are challenging, consciously or subconsciously, what we can do and what computers can do, are the ultimate participants of man-computer symbiosis. ” I guess most of us should be ordinary users because we are not hackers, proficient in code editing, or even able to manipulate trends in the network environment, we are just in the network environment, choose the network platform that suits us. As the above sentence said, most of us are participants, not pioneers who have development capabilities.</p>
